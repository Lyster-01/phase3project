# üé•Predictive Modeling and Risk Analysis of Cancer Severity and Survival Outcomes Using Machine Learning


## üîç Business Understanding
Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death globally, with its complexity and variability making treatment and prediction challenging. Health institutions are increasingly relying on data-driven approaches to improve patient outcomes. Accurate prediction of patient severity and survival likelihood can help healthcare providers prioritize care, allocate resources more effectively, and tailor treatment plans for better patient outcomes.
This project seeks to apply data science methods to a synthetic global cancer patient dataset spanning from 2015 to 2024. The key goal is to explore and predict patient health outcomes based on demographic, lifestyle, and clinical variables using both statistical and machine learning techniques.

## üß† Data Understanding
The dataset titled Global Cancer Patients 2015‚Äì2024 is a synthetic representation of cancer patient records from multiple countries. Each record includes personal demographics, environmental and lifestyle risk factors, treatment costs, cancer type and stage, survival duration, and a calculated severity score. Although synthetic, the dataset is designed to mimic real-world patterns and can be used for educational, analytical, and modeling purposes.

## üìå Problem Statement
The healthcare industry constantly seeks innovative solutions to optimize cancer care delivery and reduce mortality rates. Leveraging data science to analyze cancer-related data can provide actionable insights into patient outcomes and treatment planning.

This project aims to analyze and model cancer patient data to:

1. To compute and visualize the correlation between the Target Severity Score and continuous risk factors.
2. To investigate whether survival outcomes differ significantly across various cancer stages.
3. To predict whether a patient has a high severity score.
4. To predict whether a patient will survive more than 5 years after diagnosis.

## üîç Methodology:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**:

 Loaded the dataset, checked for duplicates and missing values, and identified outliers in the `Target_Severity_Score` column. Binarized the `Target_Severity_Score` into `High` and `Low` categories and created a `Survived_Target` based on survival years.


2. **Data Visualization**:
   
 Visualized the distribution of survival years across cancer stages, severity levels, and correlations between features. This helped TO understand the dataset better and identify key factors influencing cancer severity.

3. **Hypothesis Testing**

 Tested the hypothesis that cancer stage significantly impacts survival years. The results indicated no significant differences in survival years across cancer stages, suggesting uniformity in outcomes.


4. **Machine Learning Modeling**

Trained various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, to predict survival and severity outcomes. The models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


5. **Model Performance**

 The logistic regression model emerged as the best-performing model, followed closely by the tuned random forest classifier and tuned decision tree when predicting the severity. The models generally performed well, with recall being a key metric due to the medical context of the dataset.The models used to predict the survival outcomes did not perform as good.

6. **Limitations**

Acknowledges areas where further exploration, data collection, or improved methods could enhance the results.

**Conclusions**

This study explored cancer severity and 5-year survival prediction using machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. While the models achieved strong performance in predicting severity‚Äîespecially after hyperparameter tuning, with logistic regression performing best‚Äîthey showed limited accuracy in forecasting long-term survival, likely due to missing key clinical variables. Visualizations offered valuable insights into feature correlations, severity distributions, and survival patterns, while hypothesis testing revealed no significant survival differences across cancer stages. The analysis also emphasized the influence of factors like genetic risk, air pollution, alcohol use, smoking, and obesity on severity outcomes, highlighting the need for deeper research into lifestyle and genetic drivers of cancer prognosis.
